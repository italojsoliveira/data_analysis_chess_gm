# Data Analysis of Chess Grandmasters (GM)

Recently, the Indian-American Abhimanyu Mishra became the [youngest Grandmaster](https://www.chess.com/news/view/abhimanyu-mishra-youngest-grandmaster-in-chess-history) in chess history, qualifying for the title at the age of 12 years 4 months and 25 days, whereas the Venezuelan [Salvador Diaz Carias](https://www.chess.com/news/view/venezuela-chess-player-fm-title-88-salvador-diaz-carias) got the FIDE Master (FM) Title at the age of 88. Motivated by these news, which I came to know by the Brazilian YouTube channel [Xadrez Brasil](https://www.youtube.com/c/XadrezBrasil), I decided to do a data analysis and visualization about the GMs based on Wikipedia "[List of chess grandmasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_grandmasters)".
